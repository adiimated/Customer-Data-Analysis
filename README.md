## Goals of the project :
1. The store is launching a new product. We are finding out who the product appeals to , so that we can advertise accordingly.
2. Secondly , we find the product of the hour. It is the product with highest amount of sales.
3. Who should we sell the item to ? ( age range )

## Dataset
1. The first dataset gives the history of previous sales of a product which is similar to the new one to be launched. Analysing this dataset can help the company to understand which salary group should the product be advertised to. Also this can help the owner decide the neighbourhood in which the product would be available.
