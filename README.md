## Goals of the project :
1. Highest Selling item in the shop
2. How should the item be stacked ?
3. Who should we sell the item to ? ( age range )

## Dataset
1. The first dataset gives the history of previous sales of a product which is similar to the new one to be launched. Analysing this dataset can help the company to understand which salary group should the product be advertised to. Also this can help the owner decide the neighbourhood in which the product would be available.
